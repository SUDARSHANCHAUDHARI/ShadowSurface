Attack surface monitoring tool. Scans domains, subdomains, SSL certificates, open ports, exposed admin paths, and security headers to surface external-facing risk for a single domain or a fleet.

## Overview

ShadowSurface is a defensive reconnaissance tool that builds an external attack surface picture for a domain you own. It enumerates subdomains, checks SSL certificate validity and expiry, scans known ports, flags exposed admin paths and dev endpoints, and audits security headers. Outputs include a prioritized risk-scored inventory plus an analyst handoff report.

The current MVP is a Python CLI. A FastAPI + React web dashboard is scaffolded under `apps/` for future development.

## Features

- Subdomain enumeration from a seed domain
- SSL certificate inspection (validity, expiry, issuer)
- Common port scan
- Exposed admin and dev path detection
- Security header audit
- Risk scoring per finding and per asset
- Outputs JSON findings, risk summary, Markdown report, and triage handoff

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or newer
- Linux, macOS, or Windows
- No third-party Python packages (standard library only)
- Optional: Docker for the demo container
- Network access for live scanning (fixture mode works offline)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SUDARSHANCHAUDHARI/ShadowSurface.git
cd ShadowSurface
pip install .
```

This registers the `shadow-surface` CLI command.

To run without installing:

```bash
python3 main.py --help
```

## Usage

Audit the included fixture domain:

```bash
python3 main.py --fixture data/samples/domain-fixture.json --out-dir data/reports
```

Generated outputs in `data/reports/`:

- `findings.json` — all detected surface findings
- `subdomains.json` — enumerated subdomains
- `ssl.json` — SSL certificate inspection results
- `ports.json` — port scan results
- `headers.json` — security header audit
- `summary.json` — risk score and severity breakdown
- `report.md` — Markdown attack surface report
- `triage.md` — analyst triage checklist

## Testing

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'
```

## Docker Demo

```bash
docker compose run --rm api
```

## Safe Use

This project is defensive and analysis-focused. Use only on domains, subdomains, and IP ranges you own or have explicit written permission to scan. Unauthorized scanning is illegal in many jurisdictions.

## Status

Working Python CLI MVP. Web dashboard scaffold present but not yet implemented.

## Roadmap

- Live subdomain enumeration via passive DNS sources
- Configurable port list per scan profile
- Scheduled recurring scans with delta alerts
- Web dashboard for asset inventory and trending
- GitHub release `v0.1.0-mvp`

## About

I'm Sudarshan Chaudhari, a Senior Quality Engineer, Test Automation specialist, and AI systems builder based in Bangkok, Thailand.

I have 13+ years of experience in software quality engineering, working across SaaS, fintech, gaming, web, mobile, cloud, and digital signage platforms. My background combines hands-on test automation with QA leadership, test strategy, CI/CD, release quality, production investigation, and cross-platform validation.

Alongside my professional QA career, I run [SudarshanTechLabs](https://sudarshantechlabs.com/), my independent engineering and product lab where I design, build, test, and ship software across Android, web, AI, cybersecurity, developer tooling, and cross-platform applications.

### What I work on

- ⚙️ **Quality Engineering & Test Automation** — Playwright, Selenium, Cypress, Appium, API testing, automation frameworks, end-to-end testing, CI/CD, release gates, GitHub Actions, risk-based testing, and production validation
- 🤖 **AI Systems & Automation** — AI agents, multi-agent orchestration, MCP servers, AI-assisted QA, prompt tooling, developer workflows, automation systems, and Claude Code plugins
- 📱 **Mobile & Cross-Platform Applications** — Android applications built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, Google Play releases, automated build and publishing pipelines, and cross-platform development spanning iOS, web, Windows, and macOS
- 🌐 **Web Applications & Platforms** — Full-stack applications using Next.js, TypeScript, Firebase, Cloudflare, REST APIs, and modern web infrastructure
- 🛠️ **Developer Tooling & CLI Engineering** — Rust, Python, TypeScript, CLI utilities, multi-repository tooling, build automation, release tooling, and engineering productivity systems
- 🛡️ **Cybersecurity & Observability** — Threat detection, log analysis, security auditing, vulnerability assessment, monitoring, and security-focused developer tools
- 📺 **Digital Signage & Device Platforms** — Content validation, playback testing, device compatibility, production investigation, monitoring, and QA across diverse hardware and operating-system environments

My work sits at the intersection of quality engineering, automation, AI, and software development. I approach products with a QA mindset from the beginning: understanding failure modes, designing for testability, automating repetitive work, and building release confidence into the engineering process.

Through SudarshanTechLabs, I also build products and tools from idea to production, covering architecture, development, testing, CI/CD, release automation, monitoring, and ongoing maintenance.
